Once you start the code, the players will need to type in the number of the box they want to choose.
Once a winner is found, the game stops (even if not all boxes are picked) and declares the winner.
If the game ends in a draw, a draw is declared.
If a player picks a number that has already been picked in previous turns, it prompts the user for another number until a valid one is picked.
